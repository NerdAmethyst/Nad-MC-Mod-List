# 📜Guide

The is separated between mods, shaders, resource packs, and data packs in a single .md file (*README*).<br>
<br>
The mod list contains all the mods and categorized as Libraries & APIs, Optimization mods, Alternative mods for Optifine features, Quality of Life (QOL) mods, Vanilla+ Tweaks mods, Visual, Auditory, Utility, and Exploration & World Gen Mods.<br> 
<br>
🔹The **Libraries & APIs** are dependency mods required by dependent mods in order to run or function.<br>
🔹**Optimization Mods** *(also known as Performance Mods)* are mods that provide performace improvements by optimizing how the game handles and mitigate the use on resources.<br>
🔹**Optifine Alternatives** are mos that offer features as alternatves to using Optifine.<br>
🔹**Quality of Life** mods improves gameplay experience by adding convinient and useful features for ease of use.<br>
🔹**Vanilla+ Tweaks** are mods that build upon vanilla features, adding or improving the vanilla gameplay.<br>
🔹**Visual** mods improves the visual experience during gameplay.<br>

🔹**Utility** mods add useful features and tools in-game.<br>
🔹**World Gen and Exploration** mods improves terrain by changing world generation. Adding new features, structures, and biomes to explore making exlopartion more enjoyable.<br>

#

📌 Some mods require dependencies in order to run or function properly. If the game fails to run or crashed, there might be dependencies missing, incompatible or wrong version, wrong mod loader, or mods that aren't compatible with one another. To troubleshoot, make sure all your mods are compatible, check for missing mods, and make sure you're using the right version and mod loader.<br>

📌 For Shaders, make sure to use the full releases and correct versions to avoid bugs and glitches, and to ensure compatability with the latest version of ***Iris shaders***. For resource packs and data packs, make sure the pack uses the right pack format/s that supports your game version.

#

📌&nbsp; I provided label guides for the list which reflects on what resources I currently use and how essential each of them for my gameplay.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This only reflects my personal gameplay style which you are free to use as a guide and modify to fit your own style.<br>

# 🏞Shaders

🗒️This is a list of shaders I use for gameplay and basis for creating a PBR resource pack. I download the shaders from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com "Only download shaders from trusted sources."). Shaders are also available to download from [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft "Only download Shaders from trusted sources.").<br>

> 📌 For more information about shaders you can visit their own pages through Modrinth or Curseforge, or visit [shaderLABS](https://shaderlabs.org/wiki/Main_Page "More information about Minecraft shaderpacks made by the shaderLABS community"). I use [this](https://shaderlabs.org/wiki/LabPBR_Material_Standard "LabPBR Material Standard") as a guide for making PBR textures.
> 
> 📌 I separated the shders into different tables based on how frequently use them and which ones I use for making PBR textures.
>
> 📌‼️*Some information about the features might be wrong due to not being specified in shaderLABS or the mod's page.*
